Microservice Architecture,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">Microservices,</a></strong> often deployed out-of-container or using an embedded HTTP server, are a move away from traditional large technical services. This approach trades benefits such as maintainability for additional operational complexity. These drawbacks are typically addressed using infrastructure automation and continuous deployment techniques. We use <strong><a href=""https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html"">Microservice patterns</a></strong> <b>for better solutions for drawbecks and bottlenecks.</b> On balance, microservices are an effective way of managing technical debt and handling different scaling characteristics especially when deployed in a service oriented architecture built around business capabilities.</p> "
DevSecOps,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.sumologic.com/insight/devsecops-rugged-devops/"">DevSecOps</a></strong> adopts a philosophy of integrating security practices within the DevOps process. It encourages flexible collaboration between <b>developers (Dev)</b>, <b>security (Sec)</b>, and <b>Ops</b> teams. The main objective of DevSecOps is to close the traditional gap between software development and security while ensuring rapid delivery and deployment of code in a safe manner.</p>"
Cloud Native Applications,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p>Cloud native is a term used to describe container-based environments. Cloud-native technologies are used to develop applications built with services packaged in containers, deployed as microservices and managed on elastic infrastructure through agile DevOps processes and continuous delivery workflows. Cloud-native applications are deployed on infrastructure that abstracts the underlying compute, storage and networking primitives.The controller and scheduler, which are essential components of the orchestration engine, handle resource allocation and the life cycle of applications.<strong><a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a></strong> is an ideal platform for running contemporary workloads designed as cloud-native applications. .</p>"
Multi Tenant Infrastructure,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p>In the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we’re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.
<strong><a href=""https://digitalguardian.com/products/threat-aware-data-protection-platform"">Digital Guardian’s Data Protection Platform</a></strong> leverages software as a service, or SaaS, to provide data protection in a package that results in superior security, better economics, and reduced overhead. One of the ways we do this is through multi-tenant architecture.</p>"
API Gateway,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p>An API gateway takes all API calls from clients, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing, composition, and protocol translation. Typically it handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results, to determine the best path. It can translate between web protocols and web‑unfriendly protocols that are used internally. Open source solutions such as <strong><a href=""https://konghq.com/kong"">Kong, </a></strong><strong><a href=""https://tyk.io/"">Tyk</a></strong> and Kubernetes-native solutions <strong><a href=""https://www.getambassador.io/"">Ambassador</a></strong> implementing some API Gateway tools</p>"
Domain Driven Design,trial,techniques,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/"">Domain Driven Design</a></strong> advocates modeling based on the reality of business as relevant to our use cases. As it is now getting older and hype level decreasing, many of us forget that the DDD approach really helps in understanding the problem at hand and design software towards the common understanding of the solution. When building applications, DDD talks about problems as domains and subdomains. It describes independent steps/areas of problems as bounded contexts, emphasizes a common language to talk about these problems, and adds many technical concepts, like <strong><a href=""https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/05/21/entities-value-objects-aggregates-and-roots/"">entities, value objects and aggregate root rules</a></strong> to support the implementation.</p>"
Container Security Scanning,trial,techniques,TRUE,"<p>The container revolution around <strong><a href=""https://www.docker.com/"">Docker</a></strong> has massively reduced the friction in moving applications between environments, fueling increased adoption of continuous delivery and continuous deployments. The latter, especially, has blown a rather large hole in the traditional controls over what can go to production. The technique of container security scanning is a necessary response to this threat vector. Tools in the build pipeline automatically check containers flowing through the pipeline against known vulnerabilities. <strong><a href=""https://coreos.com/blog/vulnerability-analysis-for-containers/"">CoreOS</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://www.twistlock.com/container-security/"">Twistlock</a></strong> implementing some container security tools</p>"
Service Mesh,trial,techniques,TRUE,"<p><b>A service mesh</b> offers consistent discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or ESB. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container. These proxies communicate with service registries, identity providers, log aggregators and other services. Service interoperability and observability are gained through a shared implementation of this proxy but not a shared runtime instance. Open source projects such as <strong><a href=""https://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://istio.io/"">Istio</a></strong> will continue to mature and make service meshes even easier to implement.</p>"
GitOps,trial,techniques,TRUE,"<p>GitOps is a way to do any cluster management such as <strong><a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a></strong> and application delivery.  It works by using <strong><a href=""https://git-scm.com/"">Git</a></strong> as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests or push to master directly to accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to cluster manager.</p>"
ADR,trial,techniques,TRUE,"<p>Although much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests, in a world of evolutionary architecture it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members and for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Although these items are often stored in a wiki or collaboration tool, we generally prefer storing them in source control with simple markup.</p>"
Micro Frontends,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p><b>Microservices architectures</b> has many benefits, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create front-end monoliths — a single, large and sprawling browser application — on top of their back-end services. In this approach, the web application is broken down into its features, and each feature is owned, frontend to backend, by a different team. This ensures that every feature is developed, tested and deployed independently from other features. Multiple techniques exist to recombine the features — sometimes as pages, sometimes as components — into a cohesive user experience. <strong><a href=""https://www.mosaic9.org/"">Zalando</a></strong>uses this technique as Project Mosaic</p>"
Serverless Framework,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p>The popular <strong><a href=""https://serverless.com/"">Serverless Framework</a></strong> provides tooling for scaffolding and deployment of serverless applications, primarily using <strong><a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/tr/lambda/"">AWS Lambda</a></strong> and other AWS offerings. Serverless Framework provides template support for JavaScript, Python, Java and C#, and has an active community that contributes plugins that extend the framework. The framework also supports the Apache incubator project OpenWhisk as an alternative to AWS Lambda.</p>"
DataOps,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.datascience.com/resources/white-papers/dataops-with-mapr"">DataOps</a></strong>, or data operations, is the latest agile operations methodology to spring from the collective consciousness of IT and big data professionals. It focuses on cultivating data management practices and processes that improve the speed and accuracy of analytics, including data access, quality control, automation, integration, and, ultimately, model deployment and management.
At its core, DataOps is about aligning the way you manage your data with the goals you have for that data. If you want to, say, reduce your customer churn rate, you could leverage your customer data to build a recommendation engine that surfaces products that are relevant to your customers  — which would keep them buying longer. But that’s only possible if your data science team has access to the data they need to build that system and the tools to deploy it, and can integrate it with your website, continually feed it new data, monitor performance, etc., an ongoing process that will likely include input from your engineering, IT, and business teams.  </p>"
ChatOps,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p><b>ChatOps</b> is the use of chat clients, chatbots and real-time communication tools to facilitate how software development and operation tasks are communicated and executed.
In a ChatOps environment, the chat client serves as the primary communication channel for ongoing work. Tools that developers and operations managers already use are integrated into a collaborative communication environment to improve ticket tracking and automated incident response. ChatOps is sometimes referred to as conversation-driven collaboration or conversation-driven DevOps.</p>"
AIOps,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p>Artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) is an umbrella term for the use of <b>big data analytics</b>, <b>machine learning (ML)</b> and other <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b> technologies to automate the identification and resolution of common information technology (IT) issues. The systems, services and applications in a large enterprise produce immense volumes of log and performance data. AIOps uses this data to monitor assets and gain visibility into dependencies without and outside of IT systems</p>"
CQRS,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html"">Command Query Responsibility Segregation</a></strong>, comes from CQS (Command Query Separation) introduced by Bertrand Meyer in Object Oriented Software Construction. Meyer states that every method should be either a query or a command. This technique Supports multiple denormalized views that are scalable and performant, improved separation of concerns = simpler command and query models and Necessary in an event sourced architecture</p>"
Low Code Platforms,hold,techniques,TRUE,"<p>Low-code platforms use graphical user interfaces and configuration in order to create applications. Unfortunately, low-code environments are promoted with the idea that this means you no longer need skilled development teams. Such suggestions ignore the fact that writing code is just a small part of what needs to happen to create high-quality software—practices such as source control, testing and careful design of solutions are just as important. Although these platforms have their uses, we suggest approaching them with caution, especially when they come with extravagant claims for lower cost and higher productivity.</p>"
Model Driven Development,hold,techniques,TRUE,<p>Model-driven development (MDD) leverages graphical models and pre-built application components so that users can visually construct complex applications. Interest in model-driven development continues to increase as individuals experience the ease and speed with which technical and business users orchestrate and deploy business applications. There are two core concepts associated with model-driven development: abstraction and automation. The software application model is defined on a higher abstraction level and then converted into a working application using automated transformation or interpretations. </p>
Azure Devops,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/"">Azure DevOps</a></strong> services include a set of managed services such as hosted Git repos, CI/CD pipelines and artifact repository. Azure DevOps services have replaced <strong><a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=vsts#vsts"">Visual Studio Team Services</a></strong>. We're hoping that Azure DevOps services improve over time to provide a good developer experience when hosting applications on Azure, with a frictionless experience integrating with other Azure services.</p>"
Azure Kubernetes Service,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/"">Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a></strong> is the quickest way to use Kubernetes on Azure. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. It also eliminates the burden of ongoing operations and maintenance by provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on demand, without taking your applications offline. <strong><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/"">Azure DevOps</a></strong> helps in creating Docker images for faster deployments and reliability using the continuous build option.
One of the biggest advantage to use AKS is that instead of creating resources in cloud you can create resources and infrastructure inside Azure Kubernetes Cluster through Deployments and Services manifest files.</p>"
Neo4j,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://neo4j.com/"">Neo4j</a></strong> is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and <strong><a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/"">ACID</a></strong> transactions. The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables — yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs. We used this platform in KocHub project</p>"
Redis,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>In-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. We used as structured cache in out projects</p>"
RabbitMQ,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>RabbitMQ is one of the most popular open source message brokers. It supports <strong><a href=""https://www.amqp.org/"">Amqp</a></strong> for messaging protocols</p>"
MongoDB,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>For problems that fit the document database model, MongoDB is now the most popular choice. In addition to ease of use and a solid technical implementation, the community and ecosystem contributed to this success. We are aware of problems where teams were tempted by the popularity of MongoDB when a document database was not a good fit or they did not understand the inherent complexity. When used appropriately, however, MongoDB has proven itself on many projects.</p>"
PostgreSQL,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.PostgreSQL is free and open source software. Its source code is available under PostgreSQL license, a liberal open source license. You are free to use, modify and distribute PostgreSQL in any form.</p>"
Istio,trial,platforms,TRUE,"<p>When building and operating a microservices ecosystem, one of the early questions to answer is how to implement cross-cutting concerns such as service discovery, service-to-service and origin-to-service security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases and resiliency. Over the last couple of years, our default answer to this question has been using a <strong><a href=""https://www.nginx.com/blog/what-is-a-service-mesh/"">service mesh</a></strong> technique. A service mesh offers the implementation of these cross-cutting capabilities as an infrastructure layer that is configured as code. The policy configurations can be consistently applied to the whole ecosystem of microservices; enforced on both in and out of mesh traffic (via the mesh proxy as a gateway) as well as on the traffic at each service (via the same mesh proxy as a sidecar container). While we're keeping a close eye on the progress of different open source service mesh projects such as <strong><a href=""https://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a></strong>, we've successfully used <strong><a href=""https://istio.io/"">Istio</a></strong> in production with a surprisingly easy-to-configure operating model.</p>"

They both allow developers to quickly create and deploy code to the cloud that needs to be scalable, lightweight and fast. </p>"
Knative,assess,platforms,TRUE,"<p>The <a href=""/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture"">serverless architecture</a> has popularized a FaaS style of programming among developers; it helps developers focus on solving core business problems with independently built and deployed functions that react to an event, run a business process, produce other events in the process and scale down to zero. Historically, proprietary serverless platforms such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws-lambda"">AWS Lambda</a> or Microsoft <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"">Azure Functions</a> have enabled this programming paradigm. <strong><a href=""https://www.knative.dev/"">Knative</a></strong> is an open-source Kubernetes-based platform to run FaaS workloads. There are few things that stand out about Knative: it's open source and provider agnostic; it implements the serverless workflow as described in the CNCF Serverless Working Group <a href=""https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/tree/master/whitepapers/serverless-overview"">whitepaper</a>; it ensures cross-service interoperability by implementing its eventing interface consistent with <a href=""https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#design-goals"">CNCF CloudEvents</a> specification; and, most importantly, it addresses a common challenge of operating a harmonized and yet hybrid FaaS and long-running container-based architecture. It easily integrates with both <a href=""/radar/platforms/istio"">Istio</a> and <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. For example, developers can take advantage of roll-out strategies that Istio implements by traffic splitting between different revisions of the functions. Developers can take benefit of Istio-provided observability not only for long-running container services but also for FaaS programs in the same Kubernetes environment. We anticipate that Knative open-source eventing interface will continue to enable new underlying source and destination event integrations.</p>"
Kafka Streams,assess,platforms,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/"">Kafka Streams</a></strong> is a lightweight library to build streaming applications. It supports basic streaming APIs such as join, filter, map and aggregate as well as local storage for common use cases such as windowing and sessions. Unlike other stream-processing platforms such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/apache-spark"">Apache Spark</a> and <a href=""https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-kafka/current/home.html"">Alpakka Kafka</a>, Kafka Streams has been a good fit for scenarios that don't require large-scale distribution and parallel processing; hence we could get away without yet another piece of infrastructure such as cluster schedulers. Naturally, Kafka Streams has been a good choice when operating in the Kafka ecosystem. Kafka Streams is particularly useful when we have to process data strictly in order and exactly once. One particular use case of Kafka Streams is to build a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture#Event_Programming"">change data capture (CDC)</a> platform.</p>"
OpenAPM,assess,platforms,TRUE,"<p>One of the challenges in adopting an open-source alternative to popular commercial packages is sorting through the complicated landscape of projects to understand which components you need, which ones play nicely together and exactly which part of a total solution each component covers. This is particularly difficult in the world of observability, where the standard practice is to purchase one comprehensive but pricey package to do it all. OpenAPM makes the open-source selection process for observability tools easier. It displays the current crop of open-source packages classified by component roles, so you can interactively select compatible components. As long as you keep the tool up to date, it should help you navigate through the confusing array of possible tools.</p>"

It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.</p>"
SonarQube,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<p>Measuring software internal quality is still a mystery, even though many source code metrics have been around for years. The problem with those metrics is they usually only capture one aspect of quality. We must consult many metrics to come to a conclusion about the overall quality of our code. Sonar is an integrated tool for checking, tracking and visualizing those metrics. It not only combines metrics together, but also mixes them with historical measures, giving us a better insight into the internal quality of the codebase.</p>"

It comes with a repository of curated Kubernetes applications that are maintained in the official <a href=""https://github.com/helm/charts"">Charts repository</a>. Helm has two components: a command line utility called Helm and a cluster component called Tiller. Securing a Kubernetes cluster is a wide and nuanced topic, but we highly recommend setting up Tiller in a role-based access control (RBAC) environment. Helm's <a href=""/radar/techniques/templating-in-yaml"">YAML templating</a> can be difficult to understand, and Tiller still has some rough edges. Helm 3 is expected to address these issues.</p>"
Grafana,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<p>When combining modern techniques and architecture styles, such as <a href=""/radar/techniques/microservices"">microservices</a>, <a href=""/radar/techniques/devops"">DevOps</a> and <a href=""/radar/techniques/qa-in-production"">QA in production</a>, development teams need increasingly sophisticated monitoring. Simply looking a graphs of disk usage and CPU utilization is not sufficient anymore, and many teams collect application and business-specific metrics using tools such a Graphite and Kibana. <strong><a href=""http://grafana.org/"">Grafana</a></strong> makes it easy to create useful and elegant dashboards for data from a number of sources. A particularly useful feature allows timescales of different graphs to be synchronized, which helps with spotting correlations in the underlying data. The templating system that is being added shows a lot promise and will likely make managing sets of similar services even easier. Based on its strengths, Grafana has become our default choice in this category.</p>"

React.js,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>In the avalanche of front-end JavaScript frameworks, <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/""><strong>React.js</strong></a> stands out due to its design around a reactive data flow. Allowing only one-way data binding greatly simplifies the rendering logic and avoids many of the issues that commonly plague applications written with other frameworks. We're seeing the benefits of React.js on a growing number of projects, large and small, while at the same time we continue to be concerned about the state and the future of other popular frameworks like <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs"">AngularJS</a>..</p>"
Redux,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>With the increasing complexity of single-page JavaScript applications, we have seen a more pressing need to make client-side state management predictable. <a href=""http://redux.js.org/""><strong>Redux</strong></a>, with its <a href=""http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html"">three principles</a> of restrictions for updating state, has proven to be invaluable in a number of projects we have implemented. <a href=""https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux"">Getting Started with Redux</a> and <a href=""https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux"">idiomatic Redux</a> tutorials are a good starting point for new and experienced users. Its minimal library design has spawned a rich set of tools, and we encourage you to check out the <a href=""https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links"">redux-ecosystem-links</a> project for examples, middleware and utility libraries. We also particularly like the testability story: Dispatching actions, state transitions and rendering can be unit-tested separately from one another and with minimal amounts of mocking.</p>"

Node.js,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>Node.js is a lightweight web container that is a strong option for development of micro services and as a server to mobile and single-page web applications. Due to the asynchronous nature of node.js, developers are turning to promise libraries to simplify their application code. As the use of promises mature within the node.js community, we expect to see more applications developed for node.js. For those teams that are reluctant to try node.js in production, it is still worthwhile to consider node.js for development tasks like running JavaScript tests outside of the browser or generating static web content from tools like CoffeeScript, SASS, and LESS.</p>"
Electron.js,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications

Swift,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>With the release of Swift 2, the language approached a level of maturity that provides the stability and performance required for most projects. A good number of libraries that support iOS development—<a href=""https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON"">SwiftyJSON</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/Quick/Quick"">Quick</a>, etc.—are now migrated over to Swift, which is where the rest of the applications should follow. Swift has now been open sourced, and we are seeing a community of developers dedicated to continuously improving development in iOS.</p>"
Python 3,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p><strong>Python 3</strong> introduced many useful features that are not backward compatible with Python 2.x. It also removed numerous Python 2.x features that were maintained for backward compatibility, making Python 3 easier to learn and use and more consistent with the rest of the language. Our experience using Python 3 in&nbsp;domains such as machine learning and web application development shows that both the language and most of its <a href=""http://py3readiness.org/"">supporting libraries</a> have matured for adoption. We were able to fork and patch minor issues of existing libraries or avoided using incompatible Python 2.x libraries that had been abandoned. If you are developing in Python we strongly encourage you to use Python 3.</p>"
Cucumber,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,<p>Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers that supports behavior-driven development. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand</p>
Karate,adopt,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>Unlike other automated API testing tools which require a fair amount of coding, even just to do basic stuff, Karate works out of the box. You can construct the most complex request-response operations with no knowledge of any programming language. All you have to do is to write the feature file using plain text Gherkin style.</p>"
Kotlin,trial,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p><strong>Kotlin</strong> has experienced an <a href=""http://sogrady-media.redmonk.com/sogrady/files/2018/03/lang.rank_.118.png"">accelerated rate of adoption</a> and rapid growth of tooling support. Some of the reasons behind its popularity are its concise syntax, null safety, ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general, and that it doubles as a great introductory language to functional programming. </p>"
Vue.js,assess,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>In the ever-changing world of front-end JavaScript frameworks, <a href=""https://vuejs.org/""><strong>Vue.js</strong></a> has gained a lot of ground as a lightweight alternative to <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs"">AngularJS</a>. It is designed to be a very flexible—and a less opinionated—library that offers a set of tools for building interactive web interfaces around concepts like modularity, components and reactive data flow. It has a low learning barrier, which makes it interesting for junior developers and beginners. Vue.js itself is not a full-blown framework; it is focused on the view layer only and therefore is easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.</p>"
React Native,assess,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>Yet another entrant into the cross-platform mobile development world, Facebook’s <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/""><strong>React Native</strong></a> brings the React.js programming model to iOS and Android developers. React Native programs are written in JavaScript, but unlike a hybrid framework such as Ionic, React Native gives developers access to native UI components on the target platform. This is an approach we’ve seen before (e.g., <a href=""http://calatrava.github.io/"">Calatrava</a>), but React Native has already inspired a substantial developer community and builds on the momentum generated by React.js. This framework could play a significant role in the future of mobile app development.</p>"
Go Language,assess,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p>The <a href=""https://golang.org/""><b>Go language</b></a> gradually changed status from ""Just Another Language"" to a valuable tool in many projects.

WebAssembly,assess,language-and-frameworks,TRUE,"<p><a href=""http://webassembly.org/""><strong>WebAssembly</strong></a> is a big step forward in the capabilities of the browser as a code execution environment. Supported by all major browsers and backward compatible, it's a binary compilation format designed to run in the browser at near native speeds. It opens up the range of languages you can use to write front-end functionality, with early focus on C, C++ and Rust, and it's also an LLVM compilation target. When run in the sandbox, it can interact with JavaScript and shares the same permissions and security model. When used with <a href=""http://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/"">Firefox's new streaming compiler</a>, it also results in faster page initialization.
